# FireFly Configurator

## Purpose
FireFly Configurator is an easy-to-use Web UI designed to allow full local configuration of the FireFly components.  Data is stored within a database and hosted in Docker.

::: info
FireFly Configurator is an optional component, since configuration files can be manually adjusted and pushed to the Controller and Clients.  However, using a single web-based UI significantly reduces the effort requried to configure, maintain, and move configurations amongst devices.
